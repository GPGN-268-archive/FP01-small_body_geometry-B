# Identifying Small Body Geometry Factors and Correlations
- **Team Leader:** Jalen Perkins
- **Other Group Members:** Madeline Pastuszek (madelinepast), Nathan Bigelow
### Summary:
-
### Background Information:
- According to the 2006 IAU resolution, small bodies are considered to be 'all objects [excluding defined planets, dwarf planets, and satellites] orbiting the Sun' [1]. Thus, small bodies can include comets, asteroids, objects in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud, small planetary satellites, and interplanetary dust and also make up a large percentage of our solar system. The variety of these bodies lends to the variety of found geometries and locations when bodies have been observed. Organizations, such as NASA, have begun an effort to catagorize and document these small bodies, usually using data collected by space craft, probes, radar imaging, and lightcurving inversion [2]. Through these methods, various databases have been created in order to help planetary scientists study and draw conclusions about small bodies in the solar system.
### Problem Statement:
-
### Questions:
- What influences a small body's geometry?
- Does where a small body exists in the solar system impact geometry?
- Is small body geometry impacted by what other bodies (large or small) exist around it?
- Do the geological components (rock, ice, dust, etc.) of small bodies impact geometry?
- Can we develop models that are similar to what already exists?
- How can these models and conclusions help us learn more about other small bodies and make predictions about a wider subject?
### Objectives:
- To recreate and develop models similar to that of the 3D Asteroid Catalogue.
- To better our understanding of how small bodies' geometry differs and is influenced by other planetary and solar factors
- To help create a more definitive conclusion about why certain small bodies have particular geometries
- To develop a stronger understanding of python components and methods of modeling and data analysis

- [3D Asteroid Catalogue] (https://3d-asteroids.space/)

### Expected Outcome(s):
- We hope that the results of this project will help us understand more about small bodies within our solar system. By organizing data and modeling these bodies, we will be able to draw conclusions about how small bodies get their geometries and what fators, such as larger bodies, gravity influences, and body compositiion, also influence their geomentry. 
- In addition, this project will help us grow more confortable with using and applying python in geophysical and planetary projects. The processes done in this work will better our abilities to load, manipulate, and process data with python, as well as creating and formulating modeling techniques that correspond with the project's requirements.

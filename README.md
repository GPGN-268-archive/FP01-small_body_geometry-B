# Identifying Small Body Geometry Factors and Correlations
- **Team Leader:** Jalen Perkins
- **Other Group Members:** Madeline Pastuszek (madelinepast), Nathan Bigelow
### Summary:
-
### Background Information:
- According to the 2006 IAU resolution, small bodies are considered to be 'all objects [excluding defined planets, dwarf planets, and satellites] orbiting the Sun' [1]. Thus, small bodies can include comets, asteroids, objects in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud, small planetary satellites, and interplanetary dust and also make up a large percentage of our solar system. The variety of these bodies lends to the variety of found geometries and locations when bodies have been observed. Organizations, such as NASA, have begun an effort to catagorize and document these small bodies, usually using data collected by space craft, probes, radar imaging, and lightcurving inversion [2]. Through these methods, various databases have been created in order to help planetary scientists study and draw conclusions about small bodies in the solar system.
